            <h2 class="sub-heading">Learn more about Kali Linux</h2>
            <p class="post-text">Kali Linux is a pre-packaged Linux distribution built around the Linux kernel. Kali Linux is designed specifically for ethical hacking and penetration testing tasks and features a host of free and open-source security tools and applications like Metasploit, Net-Caerus, and Nmap.</p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">What is Kali Linux?</h2>
            <p class="post-text">Kali Linux is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution released in March of 2013, primarily created for advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing. It used to be known as BackTrack Linux. Kali Linux contains hundreds of tools that perform various information security tasks, such as computer forensics, reverse engineering, security research, and penetration testing. It provides a multi-platform solution that is freely available and accessible to both professionals and hobbyists in the information technology industry.</p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">What is Linux and why should I use it?</h2>
            <p class="post-text">Linux is an operating system (OS), which is the primary software that a computer uses to execute tasks and communicate directions to its hardware. The operating system that competes the most with Linux is Windows. Linux is a popular and widely-used OS because it is open-source, meaning that it is free to the public, and anyone can modify and customize Linux software as they wish. The reasons to use Linux can vary from developing an app or building a video game to learning how to hack computer systems. As Linux is one of the most popular operating systems, many developers use it to develop their web applications and software programs. This means knowledge of Linux is important for anyone working with computers and software in general. Learning how to work with Linux is a necessary skill for anyone pursuing a career in ethical hacking or penetration testing</p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Why do hackers use Linux?</h2>
            <p class="post-text">tegrated command-line interface for users to customize the OS. This means anyone can modify Linux to create their own programs and software. Malicious hackers often opt for Linux because it gives them more control when using Linux, and ethical hackers need to be well-versed in Linux because it’s so popular among black hat hackers. Ethical hackers also often prefer using Linux as it has better existing security measures than Windows and doesn’t usually require third-party antivirus software.</p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">What careers use Linux?</h2>
            <p class="post-text">Many jobs in IT, software development, and cybersecurity rely on Linux skills and expertise. A career in app development generally requires a deep understanding of Linux, as many app developers use Linux as a basis for their applications. Software-focused career paths that frequently use Linux include developer and software engineering roles for Python, Java, and Linux systems. Nearly any role in cybersecurity, such as a penetration tester or ethical hacker, requires a strong knowledge of Linux. With Linux expertise and skills, you could work as a system administrator, IT professional, system architect, or database administrator. You may even work in website development, maintenance, or security, as people in those roles build a majority of their web applications on Linux.</p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">What is the core of the Linux operating system?</h2>
            <p class="post-text">The core component of any operating system is called the kernel. Linux’s core is simply referred to as the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel is a single program that manages crucial tasks such as allocating memory, communicating software functions to the computer’s CPU, and comprehending all of the input and output from the computer’s hardware. The kernel is the most important part of an OS and often runs in a separate area from the rest of a computer’s software. The kernel is just one part of a full operating system, which includes a combination of components such as the bootloader, init system, graphical server, desktop environment, and more. The name “Linux” can refer to both the kernel itself (the Linux kernel) and an operating system built around that kernel. For example, the Android OS and the Ubuntu distribution are both made using the Linux kernel.</p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">What are the best Linux distributions for beginners?</h2>
            <p class="post-text">There is a wide range of Linux distributions to choose from when learning and working with Linux. When you are first learning Linux, the distribution you choose to learn may depend on how you plan to apply your Linux skills. If you are pursuing a career in cybersecurity, you may select a different Linux distribution to start with than someone pursuing a career in game development, for instance. Online courses are some of the best resources for beginners to Linux, as they will give guidance on which Linux distribution is a good fit for the intended application of Linux. For beginners, a few of the most highly recommended Linux distributions include Elementary OS, Ubuntu Linux, and Ubuntu Budgie. Other distributions that are considered easy to learn and master are Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Nitrux, Kodachi, Rescatux, and Parrot Security.</p>
